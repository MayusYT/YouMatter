# YouMatter
### A standalone UU-Matter mod for Minecraft Forge. Why? Because it matters.
#### YouMatter is available for 1.12.2, 1.14.4, 1.15.2 and 1.16.1 (beta). Check out the respective branches.

*Huge thanks to [Hailtothebreak](https://github.com/Hailtothebreak) for the 1.16.1 port!*

You know that fluid called "UU-Matter" from IndustrialCraft2, don't you? Well, here you have it as a standalone mod.
I added some quirks that make it slightly less overpowered, such as adding an extra requirement for producing U-Matter.
## Why?
ICÂ² is outdated, has many bugs and often is just included in modpacks because of its UU-Matter features. That was the inspiration for creating a standalone mod.
